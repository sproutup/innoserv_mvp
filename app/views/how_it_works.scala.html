                    <h1>A short story</h1>
                    <p>We love emerging products - IoT gadgets, tech toys, wearable devices, smart monitors and anything innovative. About a year ago, we got totally jazzed about helping creators successfully bring rad products to the market. Kudos to crowdfunding platforms – Kickstarter, Indiegogo et al. that help fund innovation and provide pre-orders!! What’s next? Spreading awareness on these innovations among secondary adopters and scaling the user base.</p>
                    <p>While big brands have the resources to do this easily, there is a better way for up-and-coming brands: collaborating with a network of passionate social influencers to expand outreach and drive sales. The fun part for influencers is to discover innovative products, try those they are genuinely interested in, create awesome content, and spread the word.</p>

Content could be in the form of a short YouTube video, a blog/media article with photos, or a live demo via Periscope. Ideally, a trial runs for two to three weeks after you receive the product. We provide you with a shipping label to return the product. Once a product is returned, we mail you next available product from your active request list.</p>
