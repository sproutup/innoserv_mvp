                    <h1>A short story</h1>
                    <p>We love emerging products - IoT gadgets, tech toys, wearable devices, smart monitors and anything innovative. About a year ago, we got totally jazzed about helping creators successfully bring rad products to the market. Kudos to crowdfunding platforms – Kickstarter, Indiegogo et al. that help fund innovation and provide pre-orders!! What’s next? Spreading awareness on these innovations among secondary adopters and scaling the user base.</p>
                    <p>While big brands have the resources to do this easily, there is a better way for up-and-coming brands: collaborating with a network of passionate social influencers to expand outreach and drive sales. The fun part for influencers is to discover innovative products, try those they are genuinely interested in, create awesome content, and spread the word.</p>

                    <p>SproutUp’s product campaigns provide influencers who have passion for technology with an exclusive experience interacting with their favorite brands through product trials and contests. Product trials, in particular, offer influencers early access to exciting and cutting-edge tech products. We love awesome YouTubers, bloggers, journalists/writers or enthusiasts with a large following on social media such as Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. SproutUp enables an interactive platform for both influencers and brands to collaborate.</p>

                    <p>SproutUp offers a choice model that allows you to place up to 3 active bids from all available product trials. Our simplified bidding form helps you get it right, by detailing reasons why you want to try the product, your creative inspirations, and your ask (requirement to keep the product, or receive a certain amount of payment). To optimize your bid, make sure your ask reflects the true value of your social accounts, and try to come up with creative ideas to make your bid stand out.
                    Based on your profile (and what we know about you), we may also suggest you to brands. Be on the look out for emails from brands about invitations to bid for their product trials.</p>

Ideally, a trial runs for two weeks after you receive the product. We provide you with a shipping label to return the product. </p>
