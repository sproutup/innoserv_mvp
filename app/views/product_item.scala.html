              <p>The app's UI is super clean and minimal. I consider myself pretty tech savvy so figuring out the basic controls without instructions was pretty easy. My friend who is not so tech savvy eventually figured it out but had to refer to the instructions again.</p>
              <p>The apps controls are super responsive. There is little to no lag time while adjusting light settings over wifi like some other wifi controlled products I've used in the past.</p>
              <p>I did a test to see if the lights could be controlled by multiple devices at the same time. It worked pretty seamlessly. I'm not quit sure what the use case would be for that function of the top of my head, but it worked perfectly.</p>

The colors are vibrant and still just as bright as expected. The dimmer transition is smooth and responsive to the app. The bulb build quality is perfect.</p>

              <p>$149 is a fare price for the QBulb considering the competitors are all $50+ more expensive. It would be nice to see a limited time offer of $99.99. At the lower price of $99.99 I feel like you could get more consumers that aren't familiar with the wifi lighting systems to try it out. I can defiantly see myself using this now, but I would have really loved to have one of these in college. If I were to throw a party now I don't think I'd want the lights to be flashing different colors the whole time. That was not the case while I was in school.</p>

              <p>I give the QBulb a 8/10. This is a awesome product and I can't wait for them to officially launch. I've never used a wifi light before the QBulb, but out of the box I had it up and running within the 1st 15min. The quality of the product is very high end.  After doing some price comparisons I relished this is the most afordable on the market and dosnt feel cheap cheaper or of lesser value in anyway. I did some test with a non tech savvy friend to see how they felt about it, but realistically a non tech savvy person wouldn't be a typical consumer of a wifi light bulb. After he experienced the QBulb in person I asked if he would be interested in buying one. He was very interested in the product, but said it was still too expensive for lights. I couldn't figure out all of the other special features I saw in the Kickstarter video on my own. Hopefully when the QBulb is officially released there will be more information on how to do so.</p>

              <p>The packaging might need some visual treatment. If I were to pick this up off of the self from a store I would really know what I was getting.

              <p>You can't control your lights while the music is streaming. Not a big deal, but the app doesn't give any feedback about the wifi lights status. For example; if music is playing and my only options are to dim the light or turn it off the other light functions should display as disabled or the app should alert me the bulb is busy streaming music.</p>

              <p>The QBulb app works great, but might need some more instructions. After downloading the app for the 1st time I landed on the BellQ welcome screen. There are 3 options to choose from. A wifi icon, a cinema/movie icon, and a bulb icon. I selected the bulb icon like the instructions stated, but it would be even more clear if the icons had labels. (I did a test with my friend to see how fast he could set the bulb up without instructions. He figured everything out for the most part, but when he got to the app he didn't know what selection to make.) </p>

              <p>This might be nitpicky, but I feel like it makes more sense for the color mode/white light mode to be a tab or toggle option. Very similar to what you would see at the top of the "top charts" section of the iTunes Store App [ Paid | Free | Top Grossing ]. The only reason I say that is because it dosnt make sense to have a color wheel on white light mode.</p>
              <p>The instructions didn't discribe how to differentiate light A B and C from one another. Is light A the first light a consumer screws in and turns on? Does the user have to turn the bulbs on in a sequential order to determine which light is what?</p>
              <p>It's not 100% clear on how to get back to the Home screen from the bulb control page. I always have to shutdown then restart the app to get to the rest of the music and wifi settings.</p>
              <p>I found it weird that the divice settings screens weren't designed to the iPhones screen size.</p>

              <p>On the Kickstarter video I saw there was a way to sync your QBulb to your alarm clock. It might be a good idea to include the how to guide in the manual or direct the user to some tips and tricks on the website. (Instructional Youtubes have been very popular and helpful. Having some tips and tricks videos on the site might be a nice touch for the extra features).</p>

The QBulb box wasn't hooked up to any speakers at this point. My phone's output sound wasrouted to the QBulb's box. It might be a good idea to start with setting up the basic light bulb functions before going into the other features like syncing music.</p>
