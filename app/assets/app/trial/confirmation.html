                <h3>Why are we limiting to 3 active trial requests at a given time?</h3>
                <p>1. We really appreciate your passion but we’d like you to pick three products you are really excited about so you can genuinely create and share your experience. At the same time, we don't want you to feel overburdened trying multiple products.</p>
                <p>2. We're are extremely excited about receiving a number of requests from our community of enthusiastic influencers. We want to deliver our best service and by limiting 3 requests it is easier for us to operate and coordinate requests.</p>
                <p>3. If you want to change your request, simply email us and we will accommodate by canceling one of the existing requests and adding a new one.</p>
